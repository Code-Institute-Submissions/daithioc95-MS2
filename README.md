# Interactive Front-End Development Project
 
This website is a travel website for anyone interested in visiting or learning more about the island of Ireland. In addition to providing an informative service, this website will also provide the user with the ability to book tours withing Ireland. The website contains frontend development features to provide information in an interactive and aesthetically pleasing manner. 

## UX
When designing this website, I followed the 5 levels of development, a well know web design process mentioned in Jesse James Garrett's book, The Elements of User Experience. The 5 elements are as followed. The planning of each of these planes are to follow the same order as below with each plane sacrificing to following. This ensures that the main objectives for the website identified in the Strategy plane aligns all the way through to the Surface Plane which identifies the actual features on the website.
