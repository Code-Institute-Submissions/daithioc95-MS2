# Interactive Front-End Development Project
<img src="assets/wireframes/ms2_responsive_image.JPG">
This website is a travel website for anyone interested in visiting or learning more about the island of Ireland. In addition to providing an informative service, this website will also provide the user with the ability to book tours within Ireland. The website contains frontend development features to provide information in an interactive and aesthetically pleasing manner. 

## UX
When designing this website, I followed the 5 levels of development, a well know web design process mentioned in Jesse James Garrett's book, The Elements of User Experience. The planning of each of these planes are to follow the same order as below with each plane aligning to the previous plane’s requirements. This ensures that the main objectives for the website identified in the Strategy plane aligns all the way through to the Surface Plane which identifies the actual features on the website.
- Strategy Plane
- Scope Plane
- Structure Plane
- Skeleton Plane
- Surface Plane

### Strategy Plane

#### Project Objectives
- Showcase the developer’s frontend development skills.
- Provide travel information on Ireland to the audience.
- Provide information specific to the companies tours for the visitor
- Regarding tours, provide the audience with the ability to check availability and book a tour.
- Allow the audience to interact with the website to collect information in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
- Provide a means of contact for the visitor should they want to reach out to the company directly.

#### User Stories
- As a potential customer, I want to find travel information on Ireland, so that I can identify if it is a suitable holiday destination for me.
- As a potential customer, I want to find information on the company’s tours, so that I can decide if the tours are suitable to me.
- As a potential customer, I want to check availability of tours, so that I can identify if the options are feasible for me.
- As a potential customer, I want to book a tour, so that I can guarantee my place on the tour.
- As a potential customer, I want to contact the company, so that I can provide feedback or ask any unanswered questions.

### Scope Plane
The scope plane ensures that the website sections align to the objects and that these don’t grow in number throughout the project.
- Necessary sections which align to the project objectives and user stories mentioned in the Structure plane are as below. 
- For this project we will include all phase 1 sections and omit phase 2 sections until a later sprint due to resource capacity. 

#### Phase 1
The first phase of the website will consist of 5 pages. The map and testimonial sections will be located on the Home page.
- Home
  - Map
  - Testimonials
- About
- Contact
- Book a tour
- Events

#### Phase 2
The second phase will be added at a later stage due to time and content capacity. As the company is yet to give any tours, there is a lack of content for the Gallery section.
- History
- Gallery

### Structure Plane
- Navbar: The Navbar is a green colour to ensure the green brand image of Ireland is communicated to the visitor.
- Header: The Navbar colour is used as the header font color throughout.
- Backgroud: The background will consist of background images with a level of transparency applied.
- FontAwesome: Font Awesome Icons were used throughout the website to provide more information links.

### Skeleton Plane
Once the sections and layout has been identified as in the previous planes we can get started with the Skeleton Plane.
The Skeleton Planes outlines the arrangement of each section on the website and the best way to design these are by creating wireframes.
I initially drew these wireframes before creating using Balsamiq software.

### Surface Plane
The surface plane is the least conceptual plane and consists of the actual content and features on the website.

#### Features
Please see below list of features present on the website

- Navbar: A responsive Navbar will feature on the website so the user can easily navigate to other pages.
- Images: As this is a travel website, this website will be image heavy as a selling point to the visitor for what Ireland has to offer.
- Carousel: To ensure an engaging website which can portray to the visitor the beauty of Ireland, an image Carousel will be used for aesthetics and to increase the capacity for images.
- Form: To ensure the visitors can contact the company with any further queries a form will be included.
- Interactive Map: A Google Maps API will be used to provide the visitor with information based on location. 
- Testimonial boxes: Testimonial boxes of previous customer will be included so the visitor can get some further information from previous customers.
- Calendar Appointment Booking System: If the customer wants to book a tour, they can check availability and book a place using the Calendar Appointment Booking System.

## Known Bugs and Fixes
- Evo-Calendar
 - For mobile devices, when closing the events section on there appears to be an issue with closing. It is expected to gradually slide in however, it slides a fraction before closing abruntly. This is a known issue and I plan to fix this at a later stage.
